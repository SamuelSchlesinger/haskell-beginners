# Haskell Beginners

This repository is meant to help beginners learn
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), a strongly typed, purely functional
programming language.

In order to get help on any particular topic, open a pull request containing
any code that you need a hand with, along with any relevant commentary or
questions. I will then read your code, commentary, and questions, and reply
with any help I can offer.
